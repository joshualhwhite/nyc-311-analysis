# NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis

This project analyzes real NYC 311 Service Request data using **pandas** and **Google Colab**.  
The goal is to explore how long it takes different city agencies to respond to complaints — by borough, complaint type, and time period.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and processed raw 311 data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests/erm2-nwe9)
- Engineered new features like **response time (hours)**
- Found the slowest and fastest agencies by **median response time**
- Visualized key patterns using **matplotlib**
- Built a simple baseline model to predict whether a request would be closed within 48 hours

## Tools Used
Python • pandas • matplotlib • scikit-learn • Google Colab
